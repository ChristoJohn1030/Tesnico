**<h3>Welcome to Tesnico! </h3><br>**

<b><head>Hello boss....</head><br><br></b>
<body>

Wonder who **Tesnico** is...  **Tesnico** is a Telegram feauture bot created by Yours truly **Christo John** . It was my dream to create my own telegram bot since I first met someone with user name ending with **bot** in telegram. But sadly to say that I was never able to create one as I didnt knew how to make one... I tried my best exploring the internet but all was in vain... I passed through some tg bot developing books,youtube videos and a lot but there was not a single one which explained how to begin building a bot...At last after 2+years I found a youtube channel with 127 videos which explained thoroughly and deeply about **how to build a telegrambot using nodeJs** and thus I **started my journey on building my first TelegramBot** and created **Tesnico**.<br><br>

So practically speaking **Tesnico** is a **Telegram feauture bot** which I am trying to make it feauture **all and every telegram bot feautures**. **Tesnico** is not a typical application based telegram bot ,rather it is a **full fledged telegramBot** which is feauturing all and every telegram bot feautures available for telegraf library...
    As development of **Tesnico** is just started it currently features only 3 requests (commands) **/start, /Tesnico and /TesInfo...**
    Eventually**Tesnico** will be accepting more and more feautures as well as requests...
    Tesnico will be followed by a number of application based bots which are just gonna feauture single application feautures only...They can be called as derived bots of Tesnico . All their commands and feautures will be fautured by **Tesnico** and at the same time they all exist individually as well.

How it is all arranged :<br>
* There are mainly 3 folders you can see in this reposiory ...Namely Source, Requests and activities<br>
* The first one is Source folder which contains Tesnico Source code.js and package.json files:<br>
    The Tesnico Source code.js file is the real source code file of the Tesnico Bot. And the Package.json file is the file containing important informations about this project...It contains tesnico version number and different dependencies used for the project . What is its use is for you is that : first make a folder in your PC<br>Then install node.js and start a project. <br>Then copy paste the code in my package.json file to your package.json file. (Warning only copy and paste the dependencies section).
    then give npm install and now you will have the same packages and dependencies a sin my project and feel free to copy paste and use Tesnico's source code.(Replace BOT_TOKEN with a valid telegram bot token)

* The second folder is a Requests folder which contains numerous programs. They all are programs specific for only one bot request.

* THe third one is activities folder: That folder contains different miscalleneous ptelegram bot program examples

* You can try all the programs in Requests and activities folder but make sure that you replace BOT_TOKEN in the line <a> const bot = new Telegraf('BOT_TOKEN') </a> with a valid bot token and also inside single quotes 

example: <a> const bot = new Telegraf('vejjtn5ur4r78348r7389unvr3483957:00dfg');</a><br>
Where <a> vejjtn5ur4r78348r7389unvr3483957:00dfg </a> is the bot token of some bot.. (Not exactly but for example it is fine :>)

<b>Bot tokens are unique bot Id's that cannot be publicized . Once it is got by a third party they could mess up your bot...Be careful...</b>
